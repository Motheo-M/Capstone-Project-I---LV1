1. What is the project
2. How does it work

### What is the project
This project is a finance calculator program that will be used to calculate the amount of money to be gained from investing or the home loan repayment to be made on the house bond.

### How does it work
#### Investment calculator

The investment calculator asks the amount of money you wish to invest, the interest rate for said invetment and the number of years you will be investing for.
Then will the investment be a simple or compound interst rate, after which the amount of money gained from the investment will be displayed.

#### Bond calculator
The bond calculator will ask for the present value of the house, the interest rate for taking out the bond and the number of months one wishes to pay off the bond.
Then the payment, in acordance with the time based plan, will be displayed.
